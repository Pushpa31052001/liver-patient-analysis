In this project, we performed various operations, including data cleaning and data preprocessing, to prepare the dataset for analysis. These steps were essential for ensuring the data's quality and reliability, such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis.

The processed data was then visualized using a variety of plots to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. For instance, bar graphs were used to compare categorical data, while scatter plots were employed to identify relationships or correlations between variables. These visualizations provided a clear understanding of the data's characteristics and helped guide further analysis.

Additionally, we implemented machine learning algorithms to solve specific tasks, such as classification or prediction. After training and testing these models, we evaluated their performance by calculating metrics like accuracy. This allowed us to determine which algorithm was most effective for the given dataset, providing a basis for selecting the best model for future applications.
